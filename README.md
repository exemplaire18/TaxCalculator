A tax calculator that can calculate tax for an individual based on their total income and given tax slabs. The tax slabs for calculation are given below:

Tax Slab                    Tax %
0 - 3,50,000                 0%
3,50,001 - 6,25,000          9%
6,25,001 - 12,00,000         18%
12,00,001 and above          35%

Example:
If the income of a person is 25,00,000. Then the tax will be applied as: 0% for the first 3,50,000 + 9% of 2,75,000 + 18% of 5,75,000 + 35% of the remaining 13,00,000. Your output should then return total tax to be paid.
